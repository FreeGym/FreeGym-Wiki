# FreeGym Wiki Contributors
#
# This file tracks contributors, their trust status, and verification.
# It's automatically updated when new contributors join,
# but trust promotions and verification require human approval.
#
# Trust levels:
#   - contributor: Has merged at least one PR
#   - trusted: Vouched for by maintainers, can review others' work
#   - maintainer: Can merge PRs and promote contributors (star designation)
#
# Verification:
#   - checkmark: Earned by one substantive merged PR (see VERIFICATION.md)
#   - topics: Badges earned by contributing to specific folders
#   - last_active: Date of most recent contribution
#
# Contribution tracking:
#   - contributions: List of files contributed with citation counts
#   - total_citations: Sum of all citations added across contributions
#   - commits: Number of commits (low weight - easily gamed)
#
# The vouched_by field shows accountability - you can see
# exactly who decided to trust someone.

maintainers:
  # Maintainers get the star designation instead of checkmark
