# Protein RDA

The protein RDA is an individual intake goal derived from population-level requirement estimates. It is designed to cover almost all apparently healthy people, not to set an optimal target for performance or clinical care.

## What the RDA is and is not

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) framework defines the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as the average daily intake level that meets the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) apparently healthy people in a specific life-stage and sex group. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

The RDA is intended to be used as a goal for daily intake by individuals; it should not be used as a cut-point for assessing nutrient intakes of groups. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3); [Institute of Medicine, 2000 (Applications in Dietary Assessment)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9956/chapter/3))

DRI values apply to apparently healthy populations; they are not designed to cover people with disease states or markedly increased needs, where clinical judgment is required. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

## How the RDA is calculated

The method starts with the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), the intake that meets the requirement of half of the healthy population. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

If the requirement distribution is normal and its standard deviation is known, the RDA is set as EAR + 2 standard deviations. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

When variability is not well characterized, the DRI method assumes a coefficient of variation (a measure of relative variability) of 10 percent, which makes the RDA about 1.2 times the EAR. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

If the nutrient requirement distribution is known to be skewed, other approaches are used to find the ninety-seventh to ninety-eighth percentile to set the RDA. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3))

## Why the adult protein RDA is about 0.8 g/kg/day

Adult protein requirements were derived largely from nitrogen balance studies, which estimate the intake where nitrogen in roughly equals nitrogen out. ([Wolfe et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347101/))

A meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies estimated an EAR of 0.65 g/kg/day and a 97.5th percentile intake of 0.83 g/kg/day for healthy adults consuming good-quality protein (modeling the requirement distribution as log-normal). ([Rand et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12499330/))

The DRI summary tables list the adult protein RDA as 0.8 g/kg/day, expressed per reference body weight. ([Institute of Medicine, 2005](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10490/chapter/32))

The European Food Safety Authority reports similar values: an average requirement of 0.66 g/kg/day and a population reference intake of 0.83 g/kg/day for healthy adults. Its population reference intake is EFSA's RDA-equivalent. ([EFSA, 2012](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2557))

## Limits and open debates

The protein RDA was derived to estimate the minimum amount needed to avoid loss of body nitrogen, not to optimize outcomes like muscle gain or aging-related changes. ([Wolfe et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347101/))

The same review notes limitations in how the RDA is derived and applied, which is why alternative methods are used to cross-check requirements. ([Wolfe et al., 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5347101/))

## Older adults and higher estimates

An indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) study in men over 65 estimated a mean requirement of 0.94 g/kg/day and an RDA-like value of 1.24 g/kg/day. IAAO estimates requirements by tracking how oxidation of a labeled amino acid changes as intake rises. The authors noted that current recommendations for older men may be underestimated. ([Rafii et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26962173/)) More recently, an umbrella review/meta-analysis comparing methods found IAAO-derived protein requirements average ~30% higher than nitrogen balance-derived estimates, and a commissioned systematic review for potential future DRI updates judged the evidence (2000-May 2024) insufficient/inconclusive to set definitive new requirement values. ([Tagawa et al., 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40914512/))

The PROT-AGE Study Group recommends 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg/day for many adults over 65 to help maintain or regain lean mass and function, with higher intakes suggested for those who are active. The same paper notes that older people with severe kidney disease (e.g., eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) who are not on dialysis may need to limit protein intake. ([Bauer et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23867520/))

## Quick reference values (adults)

- DRI protein RDA: 0.8 g/kg/day. ([Institute of Medicine, 2005](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10490/chapter/32))
- Nitrogen balance meta-analysis: EAR 0.65 g/kg/day; 97.5th percentile 0.83 g/kg/day. ([Rand et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12499330/))
- EFSA: average requirement 0.66 g/kg/day; population reference intake 0.83 g/kg/day. ([EFSA, 2012](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2557))
- IAAO in men >65: mean requirement 0.94 g/kg/day; RDA-like 1.24 g/kg/day. ([Rafii et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26962173/))

## Practical interpretation

- The RDA is an intake goal that corresponds to a very low risk of inadequacy for apparently healthy adults, not an optimal target for every outcome; it is not intended as a cut-point for assessing nutrient intakes of groups. ([Institute of Medicine, 2000](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9810/chapter/3); [Institute of Medicine, 2000 (Applications in Dietary Assessment)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/9956/chapter/3))
- The adult RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day is the value listed in the DRI summary tables and sits close to the 0.83 g/kg/day estimates from nitrogen balance and EFSA. ([Institute of Medicine, 2005](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10490/chapter/32); [Rand et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12499330/); [EFSA, 2012](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2557))
- In older adults, evidence and expert consensus support higher intakes (around 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg/day), with even higher targets in some cases. ([Rafii et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26962173/); [Bauer et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23867520/))
