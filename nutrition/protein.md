# Protein

This page addresses the most debated questions about dietary protein.

**Status:** Seeking contributors. Each section below frames a controversy. Evidence needed.

## How Much Protein Do You Actually Need?

The RDA says 0.8g per kg of body weight. The fitness community says 1g per pound (2.2g/kg) or more. Some longevity researchers suggest less.

**Competing claims:**

1. The RDA (0.8g/kg) is sufficient for everyone, including athletes
2. Active individuals need significantly more (1.6-2.2g/kg or higher)
3. Higher protein intake may have negative long-term effects via mTOR activation

**Evidence needed:** Meta-analyses comparing protein intake levels and outcomes for different populations.

## Does Protein Timing Matter?

The "anabolic window" was fitness gospel for years. Eat protein within 30-60 minutes of training or lose your gains. Then research questioned it.

**Competing claims:**

1. Post-workout protein timing is critical for muscle protein synthesis
2. Total daily protein matters more than timing
3. Protein distribution across meals matters more than post-workout timing specifically

**Evidence needed:** Studies on protein timing and muscle protein synthesis.

## Animal vs Plant Protein

Are animal proteins superior for muscle building? Can plant-based diets provide adequate protein for athletes? Does "complete vs incomplete" protein actually matter?

**Competing claims:**

1. Animal proteins are superior due to amino acid profiles and bioavailability
2. Plant proteins are equivalent when total intake and variety are adequate
3. The "complete protein" distinction is outdated and misleading

**Evidence needed:** Comparative studies on protein sources and outcomes.

## Can You Eat Too Much Protein?

High protein diets are popular. But some claim excess protein damages kidneys, accelerates aging via mTOR, or offers no additional benefit beyond a certain point.

**Competing claims:**

1. High protein intake (>2g/kg) damages kidneys over time
2. High protein is only a concern for those with pre-existing kidney disease
3. Excess protein may accelerate aging through mTOR pathway activation
4. There's a ceiling effect where additional protein provides no further muscle-building benefit

**Evidence needed:** Long-term studies on high protein intake and health outcomes.

## Protein Supplements vs Whole Food

Is whey protein equivalent to chicken breast? Do supplements offer any advantage, or are they just convenience?

**Competing claims:**

1. Protein is protein. Source doesn't matter if amino acid content is equivalent
2. Whole food proteins are superior due to additional nutrients and food matrix effects
3. Certain supplements (whey) may have advantages for specific use cases

**Evidence needed:** Studies comparing whole food vs supplemental protein sources.

## Protein Needs by Population

Do protein needs vary significantly by age, activity level, or goal?

**Questions:**

- Do elderly adults need more protein due to anabolic resistance?
- How much more protein do athletes in a caloric deficit need to preserve muscle?
- Do endurance athletes have different needs than strength athletes?

**Evidence needed:** Population-specific protein research.

## BCAAs: Useful or Redundant?

Branched-chain amino acids were heavily marketed for muscle building. Now many say they're useless if you eat enough protein.

**Competing claims:**

1. BCAAs provide additional muscle-building benefit beyond whole protein
2. BCAAs are redundant if total protein intake is adequate
3. BCAAs may be useful in specific contexts (fasted training, low-protein diets)

**Evidence needed:** Studies on BCAA supplementation vs protein-matched controls.
