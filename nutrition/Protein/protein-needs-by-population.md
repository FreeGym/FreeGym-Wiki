# Protein Needs by Population

Protein targets are not one-size-fits-all. The evidence base suggests that **age (anabolic resistance), energy availability (caloric deficit), and training modality / training load (endurance vs strength)** can shift the intake range that best supports lean mass and performance outcomes. ([PLOS][1]; [University of Birmingham][9]; [PLOS][12])

**"Requirement" depends on how it's measured**: an umbrella review/meta-analysis comparing methods found **indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO)**–derived protein requirements to be **~30% higher** than **nitrogen balance** estimates overall. ([ScienceDirect][2])
*Method note:* this comparison is primarily **across studies** (not a within-subject head-to-head in the same participants), so some of the observed difference may reflect study design/population differences in addition to method. ([ScienceDirect][2])

## What “more protein” usually buys you

A dose–response meta-analysis of randomized trials found that **total protein intake across a wide range (≈0.5–3.5 g/kg/day)** is positively associated with increases in lean body mass, but the **marginal benefit per increment declines at higher intakes** (in their model, the slope dropped once total intake exceeded ~1.3 g/kg/day, and resistance training attenuated that decline). ([OUP Academic][3])
*Model note:* the ~1.3 g/kg/day value reflects a **modeled inflection** (not a hard physiological “ceiling”). ([OUP Academic][3])

This is the backdrop for the population-specific questions below.

## Do elderly adults need more protein due to anabolic resistance?

### Anabolic resistance is real (at least in acute physiology data)

In a large pooled comparison of tracer-based studies, older men showed a **blunted postprandial muscle protein synthesis response** to a standardized protein bolus: after ingesting **20 g casein**, postprandial MPS rates were **~16% lower** in older vs younger men (consistent with “anabolic resistance” to feeding). ([PLOS][1])

### Requirement estimates in older adults are commonly higher than 0.8 g/kg/day in IAAO studies

An IAAO study in men >65 estimated an **average requirement ~0.94 g/kg/day** and an **upper-95%-CI “recommended” value ~1.24 g/kg/day**. ([ScienceDirect][4])

That magnitude aligns with the broader finding that IAAO-based requirements run higher than nitrogen balance–based estimates in meta-analytic comparisons. ([ScienceDirect][2])

### Outcomes trials in older adults: protein helps most when paired with resistance training

A systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs in older adults concluded that **when older adults perform resistance exercise**, higher protein intake **improves appendicular lean mass and handgrip strength** compared with lower-protein controls; **without resistance exercise**, protein had **no additional benefit** for changes in lean mass or handgrip strength. ([ScienceDirect][5])

Evidence in clinically relevant subgroups points the same direction: in older adults with sarcopenia, a meta-analysis reported that **protein supplementation + resistance exercise** significantly improved **muscle mass (SMD ~0.95)** and **handgrip strength (SMD ~0.32)** vs controls, though not all functional outcomes improved. ([e-epih.org][6])

### But: higher protein alone doesn’t reliably add lean mass in all older populations

In a randomized clinical trial of functionally limited older men, increasing protein intake to **~1.3 g/kg/day** did **not** increase lean body mass or improve physical function compared with **~0.8 g/kg/day**. ([JAMA Network][7])
(Their trial did report some favorable body-composition changes—e.g., fat mass reduction—despite no LBM gain.) ([JAMA Network][7])

### Observational evidence is consistent with “low intake ↔ sarcopenia,” but causality is limited

A systematic review/meta-analysis of observational studies found that older adults with sarcopenia **consumed less protein** than peers without sarcopenia. ([MDPI][8])

**Interpretation:** Aging is associated with anabolic resistance in acute feeding studies, and IAAO-derived requirement estimates in older adults land around **~1.2 g/kg/day (upper-95%-CI “recommended” value)**. But the strongest outcome-based evidence for “more protein” in older adults is **protein + resistance training**, rather than protein alone. ([ScienceDirect][5])

## How much more protein do athletes in a caloric deficit need to preserve muscle?

The most directly relevant evidence here comes from **randomized trials** in which energy deficit is imposed and lean mass is tracked.

### Severe deficit + training: ~2.3–2.4 g/kg/day repeatedly outperforms ~1.0–1.2 g/kg/day

* In resistance-trained athletes under short-term hypoenergetic weight loss, **~2.3 g/kg/day** preserved lean mass better than **~1.0 g/kg/day**. ([University of Birmingham][9])
* In a randomized trial combining a marked energy deficit with intense exercise training, **2.4 g/kg/day** produced **greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss** than **1.2 g/kg/day**. ([American Journal of Clinical Nutrition][10])

### Higher-than-RDA protein protects fat-free mass during energy deficit in controlled trials

In a randomized controlled trial during energy deficit, diets providing protein above the RDA protected fat-free mass compared with RDA-level protein (and the paper reports preserved anabolic responses at higher intakes). ([FASEB Journal][11])

**Interpretation:** In the populations and protocols studied (typically **short-term, relatively aggressive deficits**, often **with structured training**, and frequently in **men**), the most consistent “muscle-sparing” intakes cluster around **~1.6–2.4 g/kg/day**, with multiple trials supporting **~2.3–2.4 g/kg/day** when the goal is maximal lean-mass retention under harder dieting conditions. ([University of Birmingham][9]; [American Journal of Clinical Nutrition][10])

## Do endurance athletes have different needs than strength athletes?

### Endurance: IAAO suggests higher needs on heavy training days than traditional nitrogen-balance–based ranges

Using IAAO during a controlled, higher-volume training context, endurance-trained men showed:

* **Estimated average requirement:** **~1.65 g/kg/day**
* **Recommended intake (upper 95% CI):** **~1.83 g/kg/day** ([PLOS][12])

The same paper explicitly contrasts this with lower conventional recommendations derived largely from nitrogen balance. ([PLOS][12])

### Strength: IAAO estimates in strength athletes can also be high

In male bodybuilders (rest, nontraining day) studied with IAAO:

* **EAR:** **~1.7 g/kg/day**
* **Upper-95%-CI “recommended” intake:** **~2.2 g/kg/day** ([ScienceDirect][13])

### Endurance performance/adaptation data: supplementation meta-analysis shows modest but measurable benefits

A systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs found that protein supplementation during endurance training was associated with:

* Improved aerobic capacity (e.g., mixed outcomes summarized as **SMD ~0.36**)
* Increased VO₂peak (reported **MD ~0.89 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹**)
* Greater lean mass gain (**MD ~0.32 kg**)
* Better time trial performance (**MD ~−29 s**) ([ScienceDirect][14])

**Interpretation:** Based on IAAO-derived estimates, **both endurance and strength athletes can have “recommended” intakes well above ~1.3 g/kg/day**, and the ranges **overlap substantially**. However, the headline IAAO values here are drawn from **different day types and physiological contexts** (endurance: post-exercise/heavy day; bodybuilding: nontraining day), so they should not be treated as a clean, apples-to-apples modality comparison. ([PLOS][12]; [ScienceDirect][13]) Practically, **endurance requirements may rise on higher-volume training days**, rather than necessarily being categorically lower than strength athletes. ([PLOS][12])

## Quick reference values and anchor points from the evidence

* **Older men (IAAO):** EAR **0.94 g/kg/day**, upper-95%-CI “recommended” **1.24 g/kg/day**. ([ScienceDirect][4])
* **Anabolic resistance signal:** postprandial MPS **~16% lower** in older vs young men after **20 g casein**. ([PLOS][1])
* **Older adults + resistance exercise (RCT meta-analysis):** higher protein improves appendicular lean mass and handgrip; **without resistance training**, no additional benefit. ([ScienceDirect][5])
* **Sarcopenic older adults (meta-analysis):** protein + resistance exercise improves muscle mass (**SMD ~0.95**) and handgrip (**SMD ~0.32**). ([e-epih.org][6])
* **Endurance-trained men, heavy training day (IAAO):** estimated requirement **1.65**, upper-95%-CI “recommended” **1.83 g/kg/day**. ([PLOS][12])
* **Male bodybuilders, nontraining day (IAAO):** EAR **1.7**, upper-95%-CI “recommended” **2.2 g/kg/day**. ([ScienceDirect][13])
* **Energy deficit + training (RCTs):**

  * **~2.3 vs ~1.0 g/kg/day** better lean-mass retention in athletes dieting. ([University of Birmingham][9])
  * **2.4 vs 1.2 g/kg/day** yields greater lean mass gain and fat loss under marked deficit + intense exercise. ([American Journal of Clinical Nutrition][10])
  * Higher-than-RDA intakes protect fat-free mass during deficit in RCT settings. ([FASEB Journal][11])

## Practical interpretation

* **Older adults:** The best-supported strategy for improving lean mass/function is pairing **adequate-to-higher protein** with **resistance training**, rather than relying on protein alone. ([ScienceDirect][5])
* **Dieting athletes:** If the priority is lean-mass retention in a meaningful deficit, controlled trials support moving from ~1.0–1.2 g/kg/day toward **~1.6–2.4 g/kg/day**, with particularly strong RCT support for **~2.3–2.4 g/kg/day** in aggressive deficit + training contexts. ([University of Birmingham][9])
* **Endurance vs strength:** IAAO-derived estimates suggest endurance athletes on heavy days may need **~1.8 g/kg/day**, and strength athletes in the IAAO bodybuilding study reached an upper-95%-CI “recommended” intake around **~2.2 g/kg/day**—so the practical difference is often less about “endurance needs less” and more about **training load, day type, and energy availability**.
