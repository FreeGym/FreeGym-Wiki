# Do You Need Carbs to Build Muscle?

No, carbs aren't required to trigger muscle growth when you eat enough protein. But they can help indirectly if they improve your training performance, volume, and recovery, especially during demanding schedules. ([Abdulla et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3751-0); [Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856))

The "carbs are mandatory" argument usually centers on insulin, but that claim doesn't hold up under scrutiny.

## Insulin is not a "carb-only anabolic switch"

A meta-analysis of human studies found that insulin's main effect on muscle protein balance is reducing breakdown, not increasing synthesis. Raising insulin without raising amino acids doesn't do much for muscle protein synthesis, especially when circulating amino acids actually drop. ([Abdulla et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3751-0))

In a feeding study with young and older men, researchers infused extra insulin after subjects ate 20g of casein. Insulin increased amino acid uptake into leg muscle, but it didn't further increase muscle protein synthesis. ([Groen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-1436))

Translation: You don't need a carb-driven insulin spike to build muscle, at least not when you're eating enough protein. ([Abdulla et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3751-0); [Groen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-1436))

## Adding carbs to adequate protein usually doesn't increase muscle protein accretion

Multiple studies found that adding carbs to protein doesn't boost post-exercise or post-meal muscle protein accretion when protein intake is already sufficient. ([Koopman et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00135.2007); [Staples et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e31820751cb); [Hamer et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-10-15))

This fits with the broader finding that raising insulin above normal post-meal levels doesn't increase muscle protein synthesis when you've already eaten enough protein. ([Groen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-1436))

So the "carbs are anabolic because insulin" claim needs heavy qualification: insulin does participate in post-meal muscle protein balance, but carbs don't reliably add to muscle protein accretion when you're already eating adequate protein. ([Abdulla et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3751-0); [Koopman et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00135.2007); [Staples et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e31820751cb))

## Hypertrophy outcomes across carbohydrate intakes: not required, but sometimes advantageous

### What the resistance-trained keto/hypertrophy literature shows

One meta-analysis of resistance-trained participants (5 studies, 111 people) found no significant differences in fat-free mass between ketogenic and non-ketogenic groups. The authors emphasized the small evidence base and high heterogeneity. ([Vargas-Molina et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912629))

A different meta-analysis found ketogenic diets reduced body mass and fat mass compared to non-keto diets, but also showed a pooled decrease in fat-free mass. ([Ashtary-Larky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1890689))

A Bayesian meta-analysis in athletes and trained adults reached a similar conclusion: keto diets can reduce body mass and fat mass, with a small negative effect on fat-free mass. ([Koerich et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2022.2090894))

The takeaway isn't "keto can't build muscle." It's that the pooled evidence doesn't show a hypertrophy advantage for low-carb diets, and some analyses suggest slightly worse fat-free mass outcomes depending on the studies and context. ([Vargas-Molina et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912629); [Ashtary-Larky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1890689); [Koerich et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2022.2090894))

**Note:** Most of this research measures "lean mass" or "fat-free mass," which aren't direct measures of actual muscle tissue. These measurements can be thrown off by non-muscle components like glycogen and water, both of which drop on low-carb diets. ([Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070))

### Key resistance training trials

**Energy surplus, trained men (8 weeks):** Trained men in a deliberate calorie surplus did resistance training on either a keto or non-keto diet. The keto group lost fat and visceral fat but didn't gain significant total body weight or "muscle mass." The non-keto group gained both body weight and muscle mass. The authors concluded keto "might not be useful to increase muscle mass during positive energy balance." ([Vargas et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-018-0236-9))

**Trained women (8 weeks):** Strength-trained women did an 8-week lifting program on either keto or non-keto. Keto reduced fat mass. Neither group showed significant changes in fat-free mass (keto trended down, non-keto trended up, but neither reached statistical significance). The authors said keto may maintain fat-free mass but is suboptimal for increasing it. ([Vargas-Molina et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-020-00348-7))

**High-carb vs low-carb/high-fat, trained men (15 weeks):** Resistance-trained men spent 15 weeks lifting on either high-carb/low-fat or low-carb/high-fat. The high-carb group had greater increases in BIA-estimated skeletal muscle mass and maximal strength. The low-carb group had less favorable changes, including decreased maximal strength. ([Kruszewski et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2024.02.008))

**Isocaloric keto vs western diet, resistance-trained men (10–11 weeks):** In a matched-calorie, matched-protein trial with trained men, lean body mass increased in both groups. After the keto group reintroduced carbs, they showed a further increase in lean mass. This pattern looks like glycogen and water replenishment, not rapid new muscle tissue in ~1 week. ([Wilson et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000001935); [Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070))

Fat-free mass measurements can be confounded by factors beyond actual muscle tissue. Reviews of ketogenic diet research emphasize the measurement and interpretation challenges when assessing fat-free mass changes under carb restriction. ([Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070))

## Carbs can support hypertrophy indirectly by supporting performance and training volume

A systematic review of carb manipulation studies in strength training concluded that carb intake is unlikely to affect resistance training performance in a fed state for workouts up to ~10 sets per muscle group. Higher volumes may benefit, and benefits more often appeared in studies with fasted controls or other design limitations. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856))

After glycogen depletion, carb supplementation improved performance in several studies, particularly during twice-daily workouts, though not consistently in research with matched-calorie controls. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856))

Separately, a meta-analysis shows a dose-response relationship between weekly resistance training volume and muscle mass increases. This provides a plausible pathway: carbs could matter indirectly when they enable higher quality or quantity of training. ([Schoenfeld et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))

This supports a conditional model: carbs matter most when they're a bottleneck for training output, not because they're uniquely required for anabolic signaling. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856); [Schoenfeld et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))

## Glycogen replenishment: most relevant for high-frequency or depletion-heavy training

A systematic review found carb supplementation is most helpful when training includes a prior glycogen depletion session or very frequent (twice-daily) training. Many short-term manipulations and most longer-term studies show minimal performance differences from carb intake alone. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856))

This fits with the practical observation that glycogen replenishment becomes important for athletes who must repeatedly perform high-quality sessions with limited recovery time. For typical lifters whose training doesn't systematically include depletion plus rapid turnaround, it matters less. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856))

## Quick reference takeaways

Carbs aren't required to make insulin "anabolic" in the way people usually mean it. Insulin primarily reduces protein breakdown. Higher insulin doesn't necessarily increase muscle protein synthesis after protein feeding when amino acid availability and protein intake are already adequate. ([Abdulla et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3751-0); [Groen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2016-1436))

Adding carbs to sufficient protein usually doesn't increase muscle protein accretion in controlled post-exercise or post-meal studies. ([Koopman et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00135.2007); [Staples et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e31820751cb); [Hamer et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-10-15))

Hypertrophy outcomes across low-carb vs higher-carb diets are mixed. Several trials and pooled analyses don't show a hypertrophy advantage for ketogenic or very-low-carb approaches, and some show less favorable fat-free mass outcomes. ([Vargas et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-018-0236-9); [Vargas-Molina et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-020-00348-7); [Kruszewski et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2024.02.008); [Ashtary-Larky et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1890689))

Carbs are most likely to help hypertrophy indirectly when they improve training performance or volume in high-volume sessions, after glycogen depletion, or during twice-daily training. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856); [Schoenfeld et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))

Changes in "lean mass" during very-low-carb diets are harder to interpret. Reviews highlight potential confounding in fat-free mass assessment under ketogenic conditions. ([Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070))

## Practical interpretation

If your goal is maximal hypertrophy, the evidence-aligned framing is that carbs aren't biologically required, but may be strategically helpful if they allow you to sustain higher training volumes or higher-quality sessions over time. ([Henselmans et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14040856); [Schoenfeld et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))

If you're choosing between high-carb and keto specifically for muscle gain in a surplus, multiple resistance-training trials in trained participants have shown less favorable lean-mass or fat-free mass gains in the keto condition (or outcomes favoring higher-carb comparators), even when fat loss improved. Keep in mind the interpretation limits of lean-mass proxies under carb restriction. ([Vargas et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-018-0236-9); [Vargas-Molina et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-020-00348-7); [Kruszewski et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2024.02.008); [Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070))

If you want to build muscle on keto anyway, the published literature suggests it's possible to gain or maintain lean mass in some contexts. But expect greater uncertainty in outcomes and measurement compared to more conventional mixed-macronutrient approaches. ([Vargas-Molina et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912629); [Tinsley & Willoughby, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2015-0070); [Wilson et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000001935))
