# Is Keto Safe Long-Term?

“Long-term keto safety” is hard to answer cleanly because (1) “keto” is implemented very differently across studies and real life, and (2) most randomized trials are short, so the strongest evidence mostly covers **risk factors** (lipids, blood pressure, glycemia) rather than **hard outcomes** (heart attacks, stroke, mortality). ([Springer][1])

## What “keto” means in research

Many papers define a ketogenic diet (KD) as **very low carbohydrate intake (often <20–50 g/day or <10% of energy)** with higher fat intake, producing nutritional ketosis. ([Springer][2])

In practice and trials, “keto” often overlaps with broader **low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF)** patterns, which may or may not achieve sustained ketosis and may vary widely in saturated fat, fiber, and micronutrient density. ([Springer][2])

## What long-term evidence exists (and what’s missing)

An umbrella review of meta-analyses of KD randomized trials found the **typical follow-up was short** (median ~13 weeks), and explicitly called for **long-term trials** to determine whether short-term changes translate into effects on cardiovascular events and mortality. ([Springer][1])

A 2024 meta-analysis pooling 27 randomized trials evaluated KD effects on cardiovascular risk factors, but these trials still primarily inform **intermediate markers** rather than long-term event outcomes. ([ScienceDirect][3])

For **clinical cardiovascular events**, one of the more directly relevant human datasets is observational: a UK Biobank analysis of an **LCHF pattern (not necessarily ketogenic)** linked it to higher LDL-C/apoB and higher incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over ~12 years (association, not proof of causation). ([ScienceDirect][4])

## Cardiometabolic effects: what we can say with higher confidence

### Weight, blood pressure, triglycerides, and glycemic control

A 2024 meta-analysis of randomized trials reported KD showed **benefits for triglycerides, blood pressure, weight, and glycemic control**, but also raised concerns about cholesterol changes (see next section). ([ScienceDirect][3])

In a 12-month randomized clinical trial comparing a healthy low-fat vs healthy low-carbohydrate diet (**not a ketogenic intervention by design**), **weight loss did not differ significantly** between groups, supporting the idea that long-term outcomes often depend more on adherence and diet quality than carbohydrate level alone. ([JAMA Network][5])

In a tightly controlled crossover feeding study (2-week periods) comparing an animal-based ketogenic diet vs a plant-based low-fat diet, participants ate **~689 kcal/day less** on the low-fat diet, indicating that calorie intake differences can emerge even when “low-carb vs low-fat” is the headline variable (**and noting these diets differed in more than macronutrients, e.g., fiber/energy density**). ([Nature][6])

### Lipids: LDL-C and apoB are the central long-term safety fault line

A 2024 meta-analysis of randomized trials found KD increased:

* **Total cholesterol** by ~0.36 mmol/L
* **LDL-C** by ~0.35 mmol/L
* **HDL-C** by ~0.16 mmol/L ([ScienceDirect][3])

So on average, KD tends to improve some risk factors (e.g., triglycerides) but can worsen others (LDL-C/total cholesterol). ([ScienceDirect][3])

LDL-C response is also **highly heterogeneous**. A 2024 meta-analysis of low-carbohydrate diet trials found baseline BMI strongly modified LDL response:

* Mean BMI **<25**: LDL-C increased by ~**41 mg/dL**
* Mean BMI **25 to <35**: LDL-C ~no change
* Mean BMI **≥35**: LDL-C decreased by ~**7 mg/dL** ([ScienceDirect][7])

In that same analysis, **reported saturated fat amount was not significantly associated with LDL change in trial-level meta-regression**, suggesting that "LDL rises because keto is high saturated fat" is sometimes true in individuals, but not a complete explanation across the trial literature (and meta-regression cannot rule out individual-level effects). ([ScienceDirect][7])

A controlled trial in healthy, young, normal-weight women also reported that a ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat diet can raise LDL-C, consistent with the possibility that leaner individuals may be more likely to experience LDL elevations on carbohydrate restriction. ([MDPI][8])

### Hard outcomes: cardiovascular events evidence is limited and mixed

**Observational event data (higher-risk signal):**
A UK Biobank-based study identified LCHF and standard-diet groups, measured lipids in a subset, and followed outcomes. LDL-C and apoB were higher in LCHF vs standard diet, and incident MACE was higher over 11.8 years (adjusted HR **2.18**, 95% CI **1.39–3.43**). ([ScienceDirect][4])

This supports a plausible long-term risk concern, while still being observational and therefore vulnerable to residual confounding, measurement error in diet classification, and selection effects. ([ScienceDirect][4])

**Imaging-based data in “LDL hyper-responders” (lower-plaque-burden signal, but narrow population):**
A 2024 imaging study (**matched observational comparison**) compared metabolically healthy people with KD-associated LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (mean LDL-C 272 mg/dL; mean KD duration 4.7 years) vs matched controls and reported **no significant difference in coronary plaque burden** on CAC/CCTA. ([ScienceDirect][9])

A 2025 follow-up from the same Keto-CTA program tracked 100 such individuals for 1 year and reported plaque progression was associated with baseline plaque measures, while apoB/LDL exposure metrics were not associated with plaque progression in their **exploratory analyses**. ([ScienceDirect][10])

These imaging studies are informative but should not be over-interpreted as “high LDL on keto is harmless,” because they involve a selected phenotype (LMHR/near-LMHR), have limited follow-up time for clinical endpoints, and use surrogate outcomes rather than events. ([ScienceDirect][9])

## Saturated fat as a mechanism: relevant, but not the whole story

Independent of keto, evidence syntheses and scientific advisories support that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fats lowers LDL-C and is expected to reduce cardiovascular risk. ([American Heart Association Journals][11])

A Cochrane systematic review of trials reducing saturated fat intake concluded that lowering saturated fat **reduces cardiovascular events**, with benefits emerging when saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fat and/or carbohydrate. ([Cochrane Library][12])

In real-life low-carb practice, higher saturated fat intake is common: a cross-sectional study of voluntary LCD/keto followers reported **self-reported** saturated fat intake around **18% of energy** vs **11%** in controls. ([Springer][2])

But as noted earlier, across low-carb trials, saturated fat did not fully explain LDL heterogeneity once BMI and other factors were accounted for. ([ScienceDirect][7])

## Nutrient deficiencies: plausible risk, and there is direct evidence for some nutrients

The "keto causes nutrient deficiencies" claim is too broad to be universally true, but the stronger version (**keto can be micronutrient-poor without deliberate planning**) is supported by both intervention and real-world biomarker data. ([ScienceDirect][13])

### Micronutrient intake can drop below reference ranges in interventions

In a 12-week ketogenic diet study in obese adults, reported intakes of magnesium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and potassium were below recommended values, and water-soluble vitamin intakes were also low. ([ScienceDirect][13])

In that same study, most serum mineral levels remained within reference ranges over 12 weeks, but serum calcium decreased (from ~2.52 to ~2.36 mmol/L), and the authors emphasized careful food choice and attention to calcium if the diet is continued longer. ([ScienceDirect][13])

### Real-world biomarker evidence: thiamine is a concrete example

A cross-sectional comparative study (2018–2020) of adults voluntarily following LCDs (median duration 9 months; IQR 4–36) found lower RBC thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in LCD followers vs controls (about **407 vs 633 ng/gHb**), with **3/49** LCD followers meeting a deficiency threshold vs **1/49** controls. ([Springer][2])

Reported thiamine intake from food alone was also more often below reference intake in LCD followers (43% vs 14%), and supplement use did not fully normalize biomarker differences. ([Springer][2])

This doesn’t prove keto inevitably causes clinical deficiency in everyone, but it does demonstrate a plausible long-term safety issue that can occur in real-life practice. ([Springer][2])

## Are keto’s benefits “from ketosis” or “from weight loss and adherence”?

Evidence supports a mixed answer:

* Ketogenic diets can improve several cardiometabolic risk factors in randomized trials, but LDL-C often increases on average. ([ScienceDirect][3])
* Long-term weight loss is often similar across different macronutrient patterns when diet quality and adherence are emphasized, as in DIETFITS (12 months). ([JAMA Network][5])
* Controlled feeding data show that spontaneous energy intake can differ substantially between diets (e.g., lower intake on a plant-based low-fat diet vs an animal-based ketogenic diet over 2 weeks), implying that “the diet that makes you eat less” can matter as much as “the diet that produces ketosis.” ([Nature][6])
* A 2-year trial comparing low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate approaches found low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean patterns can be effective alternatives to low-fat dieting, supporting the view that multiple strategies can work depending on patient preference and metabolic context. ([New England Journal of Medicine][14])

So if a person's main benefit from keto is sustained caloric deficit and improved adherence, it is plausible that another diet could produce similar long-term benefits without requiring ketosis, especially if LDL-C rises substantially on keto. ([JAMA Network][5])

## Quick reference: what the evidence supports (and what it does not)

* **Supported:** KD tends to improve triglycerides, blood pressure, weight, and glycemic control in randomized trials, but raises total cholesterol and LDL-C on average. ([ScienceDirect][3])
* **Supported:** LDL-C response to carbohydrate restriction is heterogeneous and appears more likely to rise substantially in lower-BMI groups in trial meta-analyses. ([ScienceDirect][7])
* **Supported (observational):** An LCHF dietary pattern was associated with higher LDL-C/apoB and higher incident MACE over ~12 years in UK Biobank analyses. ([ScienceDirect][4])
* **Supported (real-world micronutrients):** Lower thiamine status has been documented in voluntary LCD/keto followers vs controls, with some meeting biochemical deficiency thresholds. ([Springer][2])
* **Not established:** Whether long-term keto **reduces** or **increases** cardiovascular events compared with other diets in a randomized, long-term outcomes trial. The RCT evidence base is still mostly short-term. ([Springer][1])

## Practical interpretation

If you define “safe long-term” as “does not worsen established risk pathways,” keto’s long-term safety hinges on two monitoring questions that have direct evidence behind them:

1. **What happens to LDL-C/apoB for the individual?**
   Average LDL-C rises in KD RCT meta-analyses, some subgroups can see large increases, and observational data link LCHF patterns with higher MACE risk, so a large LDL/apoB rise is hard to dismiss. ([ScienceDirect][3], [ScienceDirect][4])

2. **Does the diet remain micronutrient-adequate over time?**
   Both intervention and real-world data show plausible micronutrient risks (with thiamine as a documented example), implying that long-term keto should be treated as a diet that may require deliberate planning and/or supplementation rather than assumed to be nutritionally complete by default. ([Springer][2], [ScienceDirect][13])
