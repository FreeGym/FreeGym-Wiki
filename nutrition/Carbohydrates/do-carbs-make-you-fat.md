# Do Carbs Make You Fat?

"Carbs make you fat" can mean at least two different things: (1) carbohydrates have a special fat-storing effect that operates even when calories are matched, or (2) some carbohydrate-rich dietary patterns, especially those high in ultra-processed foods or liquid sugars, tend to raise calorie intake (via appetite, food reward, convenience, or food processing), and the resulting calorie surplus drives fat gain. ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008); [Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))

The highest-control evidence (metabolic ward and controlled-feeding studies) lets you separate "macros" from "calories," and it generally finds that carbohydrate-to-fat ratio has small effects on fat loss and energy expenditure when energy intake and protein are controlled. ([Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052); [Ludwig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa350))

## What "carbs make you fat" is and is not

If the claim is "carbs cause fat gain independent of calories," the relevant tests are isocaloric (same-calorie) comparisons that tightly control intake, ideally inpatient or ward studies. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021); [Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052))

If the claim is "carbs make you eat more," then ad libitum (eat-as-much-as-you-want) feeding trials and longer free-living RCTs become central, because the pathway is via energy intake rather than a calorie-independent metabolic effect. ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008); [Naudé et al., 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD013334_low-carbohydrate-diets-or-balanced-carbohydrate-diets-which-works-better-weight-loss-and-heart))

If the claim is "only refined carbs are the issue," the best evidence tends to be food-based (refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, ultra-processed foods), not macro-based. ([Schlesinger et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy092); [Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))

## Metabolic ward tests: do carbs have a special fat-storing effect when calories are matched?

A tightly controlled inpatient metabolic ward study in people with obesity compared a calorie deficit created by reducing dietary fat versus reducing dietary carbohydrate. It found greater body fat loss with dietary fat restriction than with carbohydrate restriction, even though carbohydrate restriction increased fat oxidation. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021))

In an inpatient study where participants switched from a baseline higher-carbohydrate diet to an isocaloric ketogenic diet, measured energy expenditure increased modestly, but body fat loss did not accelerate. It actually slowed relative to the prior period, which is inconsistent with a large "metabolic advantage" for carbohydrate restriction under matched calories. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

A meta-analysis of 32 controlled feeding studies with equal protein and calories varying primarily by carbohydrate-to-fat ratio found small differences in measured energy expenditure and body fat loss. On average, lower-fat (higher-carb) diets showed slightly greater energy expenditure and fat loss. ([Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052))

Taken together, high-control feeding evidence does not support the idea that dietary carbohydrate has a uniquely fattening, calorie-independent effect that dominates fat loss outcomes under matched intake. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021); [Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052))

## Insulin and the carbohydrate-insulin model: what it predicts vs what tests show

The carbohydrate-insulin model (CIM) proposes that rapidly digestible carbohydrates increase insulin and related hormonal signals, shifting fuel partitioning toward fat storage and away from oxidation, thereby promoting positive energy balance (including via increased hunger or reduced expenditure). ([Ludwig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab270))

In a 2025 randomized trial designed to test a key CIM prediction (higher-glycemic-index meals should increase hunger and increase intake at a subsequent meal), meals produced the expected glucose/insulin differences, but subjective hunger did not differ, and subsequent intake did not increase after high-GI meals at the group level. Individual-level associations did not support the model's predicted direction either. ([Liu et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.01.015))

A meta-analysis focused on total energy expenditure (TEE) across 29 controlled-feeding studies reported that the direction and magnitude of TEE differences can vary with study design and duration. This means the "energy expenditure advantage" question is sensitive to design and time course. ([Ludwig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa350))

Even where TEE differences appear, the controlled-feeding literature overall does not support a consistently large (hundreds of kcal/day) metabolic advantage for low-carb diets under matched energy intake and protein in the way strong CIM claims often imply. ([Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052); [Ludwig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa350))

## "Carbs increase appetite and make you eat more": what controlled trials show

A meta-analysis of randomized crossover trials testing high- vs low-glycemic-index breakfasts found no difference in subsequent short-term energy intake among healthy participants. ([Sun et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu8010037))

A more direct, modern test of the same conceptual pathway (GI → hunger → next-meal intake) likewise reported no significant group differences in subjective hunger and no high-GI-driven increase in subsequent meal intake. ([Liu et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.01.015))

In contrast, an inpatient randomized crossover trial comparing ultra-processed vs unprocessed diets (both offered ad libitum and designed to match presented calories and key nutrients/macros) found ~500 kcal/day higher energy intake on the ultra-processed diet and corresponding short-term weight gain versus weight loss on the unprocessed condition. This shows that food form and processing can powerfully affect intake even when "macros" aren't the intended lever. ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008))

The strongest experimental support for "diet causes overeating" often points more to processing, palatability, and food environment than to carbohydrate quantity alone (especially when carbohydrate quality is held constant). ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008); [Schlesinger et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy092))

## "Only refined carbs are the problem": where the signal is strongest

A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies reported inverse associations for whole grains with overweight/obesity risk and positive associations for refined grains with overweight/obesity risk. Effects were modest and observational, but directionally consistent with the "quality matters" framing. ([Schlesinger et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy092))

A large, updated systematic review and meta-analysis (prospective cohorts + RCTs) found that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) show a consistent relationship with weight gain. In adults, each serving/day increase was associated with higher body weight in cohorts. RCTs showed weight gain when SSBs were added and weight loss when they were reduced/subtracted versus control. ([Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))

These findings support a narrower and more evidence-aligned claim: some high-refinement carbohydrate sources (especially liquid sugars) and ultra-processed dietary patterns are more reliably linked to higher energy intake and weight gain than carbohydrate intake as a macronutrient category. ([Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008); [Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008))

## What longer-term diet trials imply about "carbs vs calories"

A Cochrane systematic review of randomized trials (3 months to 2 years) concluded there is probably little to no difference in weight loss between low-carbohydrate and balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, with average differences around ~1 kg in the short term and less than 1 kg in the long term (across people with and without type 2 diabetes). ([Naudé et al., 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD013334_low-carbohydrate-diets-or-balanced-carbohydrate-diets-which-works-better-weight-loss-and-heart))

This pattern is consistent with the idea that, for many people, the main driver of fat loss is sustained energy deficit and adherence. Carbohydrate level may mainly matter insofar as it changes food choices, hunger, and the practicality of maintaining lower intake. ([Naudé et al., 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD013334_low-carbohydrate-diets-or-balanced-carbohydrate-diets-which-works-better-weight-loss-and-heart); [Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008))

## Quick reference findings

In controlled inpatient energy-deficit conditions, reducing fat produced greater body fat loss than reducing carbohydrate, despite higher fat oxidation with carb restriction. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021))

Across controlled feeding studies with equal protein, differences in energy expenditure and fat loss between higher-carb/lower-fat vs lower-carb/higher-fat diets are small on average. ([Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052); [Ludwig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa350))

The "high-GI → more hunger → more eating next meal" pathway has not shown consistent support in randomized evidence, including a 2025 dedicated CIM test. ([Sun et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu8010037); [Liu et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.01.015))

The strongest experimental evidence for diet-driven overeating in tightly controlled conditions points to ultra-processed foods increasing calorie intake and weight over short periods. ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008))

"Refined carb" markers with the strongest weight-gain evidence include sugar-sweetened beverages, supported by cohorts and RCTs. ([Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))

Over months to years, low-carb and balanced-carb weight-reducing diets show similar average weight loss in randomized trials. ([Naudé et al., 2022](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD013334_low-carbohydrate-diets-or-balanced-carbohydrate-diets-which-works-better-weight-loss-and-heart))

## Practical interpretation

If your question is "Do carbs have a special fat-storing effect even when calories are controlled?" the best-controlled evidence suggests no large, consistent advantage to cutting carbs for body fat loss under matched energy/protein. Some data actually favor fat restriction for fat loss in short-term inpatient deficits. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021); [Hall et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.052))

If your question is "Can carb-focused strategies help fat loss in real life?" they can, but primarily when they reduce overall calorie intake (e.g., by limiting ultra-processed foods, liquid sugars, or highly palatable refined products). Not because carbohydrate is uniquely fattening as a macronutrient. ([Hall et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008); [Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))

If you want the most evidence-aligned "carbs" target, the signal is stronger for carb quality (SSBs, refined grains, ultra-processed patterns) than for carbohydrate quantity alone. ([Schlesinger et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy092); [Nguyen et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.11.008))
