# Are Whole Grains Actually Better?

Short answer: yes, in most real-world diets.

The strongest evidence comes from large prospective cohorts. Higher whole-grain intake is consistently linked to lower cardiometabolic risk, while refined grains show weaker and less consistent associations. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010); [Aune et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-013-9852-5))

Randomized trials show a smaller effect. Replacing refined grains with whole grains improves some risk markers (especially LDL in oat-based interventions, and in some analyses HbA1c and inflammation), but most trials are too short to test outcomes like heart attacks or mortality directly. ([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))

## What "whole grain" means (and what it doesn't)

A Whole Grain Initiative consensus paper defines whole grain (as an ingredient) as the edible kernel, intact or processed (ground, cracked, flaked, etc.), with endosperm, germ, and bran preserved in the same relative proportions as the intact grain. ([van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))

That definition allows substantial processing, including milling, as long as the anatomical fractions are still present in original proportions. It also reflects common industrial practice where fractions are separated and then recombined. ([van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))

The same paper proposes a whole-grain food definition by dry weight: >=50% whole-grain ingredients can be called "whole grain" in the product name; foods with 25-50% can claim they contain whole grain but should not use "whole grain" as the product name descriptor. ([van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))

This directly addresses the "added bran" objection. Adding bran to refined flour is not equivalent to a whole-grain ingredient, because true whole grain requires bran, germ, and endosperm in original proportions. ([van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))

## What prospective cohort meta-analyses show

### Cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality

A 2023 dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohorts (24 articles, 68 studies, 1,624,407 participants) found lower risk of multiple outcomes with higher whole-grain intake. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))

Per +30 g/day whole grains, summary relative risks (RRs) were:

* Stroke: 0.98
* Coronary heart disease (CHD): 0.94
* Heart failure: 0.97
* Cardiovascular disease (CVD): 0.92
* All-cause mortality: 0.94

([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))

In the same analysis, refined grains were not significantly associated with stroke, CHD, heart failure, or CVD. A positive all-cause mortality association appeared only in restricted cubic spline modeling, and the refined-grain meta-evidence was rated low quality. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))

Evidence quality for whole grains was rated high for CVD and all-cause mortality (moderate for stroke and CHD; low for heart failure). ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))

### Type 2 diabetes

A dose-response meta-analysis of cohorts (to June 2013) found lower type 2 diabetes risk with higher whole-grain intake, with no clear association for refined grains. ([Aune et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-013-9852-5))

Per +3 servings/day, RR was 0.68 for whole grains and 0.95 for refined grains. ([Aune et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-013-9852-5))

The same analysis found higher diabetes risk with white rice intake and inverse associations for some whole-grain subtypes (including wheat bran and brown rice), though some subtype estimates came from relatively few studies. ([Aune et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-013-9852-5))

### Hypertension

A 2025 systematic review/meta-analysis of prospective cohorts (searches through July 25, 2024) reported lower hypertension risk with higher whole-grain intake and near-null estimates for refined grains. ([Aune et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-05197-5))

Whole grains:

* High vs low RR: 0.74
* Per +90 g/day RR: 0.86

Refined grains:

* High vs low RR: 0.94
* Per +90 g/day RR: 0.97

([Aune et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-05197-5))

## What randomized trials show (and why effects look smaller)

A systematic review/meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials that replaced refined grains with whole grains found improvements in some cardiometabolic risk factors, with stronger lipid effects in oat-based interventions. ([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))

In pooled results:

* Whole-grain oats improved total cholesterol (SMD -0.54) and LDL cholesterol (SMD -0.57).
* In higher-quality studies, whole-grain interventions improved HbA1c (SMD -0.33) and C-reactive protein (SMD -0.22).

([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))

These are surrogate markers. Most trials are short and heterogeneous (grain type, processing, background diet), so they cannot by themselves confirm long-term effects on hard endpoints. ([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))

## Processing matters: "whole grain" is not one thing

A randomized crossover trial in adults with type 2 diabetes compared two 2-week diets with nutrient-matched whole-grain foods (wheat, oats, brown rice) that mainly differed by processing level (less processed vs finely milled), using continuous glucose monitoring. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

Despite similar increases in an objective whole-grain biomarker and no reported difference in energy intake, less-processed whole grains produced lower postprandial glucose (9% lower after breakfast; 6% lower after all meals) and lower day-long glycemic variability than finely milled whole grains. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

So grain structure and particle size can matter, even when fiber and macronutrients are similar. That is relevant to the claim that "whole grain products are just refined starch with added bran." ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

## Are refined grains harmful?

In Hu et al. (2023), refined grains were not significantly associated with stroke, CHD, heart failure, or CVD, and only showed a positive all-cause mortality association in spline modeling; evidence quality was rated low. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))

Gaesser (2024) also reported no clear pooled association between refined grain intake and CVD risk in meta-analyses of prospective cohorts. Interpretation still depends on study quality and heterogeneity. ([Gaesser, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2022.08.002))

At very high intakes, risk may increase. In PURE (21 countries), the highest refined-grain group (>=350 g/day) had higher total mortality (HR 1.27) and major CVD events (HR 1.33) versus the lowest intake group (<50 g/day). Whole grains were not significantly associated with those outcomes in that specific analysis. ([Swaminathan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4948))

## Fiber explains a lot, but probably not everything

Whole grains are strongly tied to cereal fiber intake because bran is preserved. A major Lancet series reported that higher dietary fiber intake was associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and lower incidence of CHD, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer in observational evidence, with trial support for improvements in risk factors. ([Reynolds et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2818%2931809-9))

In adults with diabetes/prediabetes, a systematic review/meta-analysis found that higher fiber intake was associated with lower premature mortality, and increasing fiber improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors in trials. ([Reynolds et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003053))

Still, the processing trial above suggests fiber amount alone does not capture the full effect. Grain structure can change glycemic response even when whole-grain content and macronutrients are matched. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

## Limits and open debates

* Cohort studies can have residual confounding, and "whole grain" versus "refined grain" definitions vary across studies and countries. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010); [van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))
* Refined-grain evidence is less consistent and was rated low quality in at least one recent meta-analysis. So "refined grains are harmless" is less supported than "whole grains are beneficial." ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))
* RCTs are mostly short-term biomarker studies and vary by grain type (for example oats vs wheat), processing, and background diet. They support some risk-factor improvements but do not directly establish lower disease endpoints. ([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))
* "Whole grain" includes very different physical forms, and at least one RCT suggests less-processed forms may produce better glycemic profiles than finely milled forms. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

## Quick reference values

* CVD risk per +30 g/day whole grains: RR 0.92; refined grains not significantly associated with CVD in the same meta-analysis. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))
* CHD risk per +30 g/day whole grains: RR 0.94; refined grains not significantly associated with CHD. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))
* All-cause mortality per +30 g/day whole grains: RR 0.94; refined grains showed a positive association only in spline modeling and evidence quality was low. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))
* Type 2 diabetes per +3 servings/day: whole grains RR 0.68; refined grains RR 0.95. ([Aune et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-013-9852-5))
* Hypertension: whole grains high vs low RR 0.74; refined grains high vs low RR 0.94. ([Aune et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-05197-5))
* PURE cohort (very high refined grains): >=350 g/day vs <50 g/day associated with higher mortality (HR 1.27) and major CVD events (HR 1.33); whole grains not significant in that analysis. ([Swaminathan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4948))
* RCT meta-analysis (refined-to-whole substitutions): improvements reported in LDL (especially with oats), HbA1c (in higher-quality studies), and CRP (in higher-quality studies). ([Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))
* RCT processing trial: less-processed versus finely milled whole grains lowered postprandial glucose and glycemic variability in type 2 diabetes. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))

## Practical interpretation

* The strongest and most consistent human evidence supports higher whole-grain intake for lower CHD/CVD risk and lower all-cause mortality risk. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010))
* "The difference is marginal because both are processed starch" does not fit the full evidence. Cohort data show consistent inverse associations for whole grains, and RCTs show measurable, usually modest, improvements in several risk markers when refined grains are replaced with whole grains. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010); [Marshall et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.06.021))
* "Whole grains are better mostly because of fiber" is broadly compatible with current evidence, but likely incomplete because structure and processing also affect responses. ([Reynolds et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2818%2931809-9); [Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263))
* "Refined grains are harmful" is too broad. Many meta-analyses show null or uncertain associations, but very high intakes have been linked to higher risk in some cohorts. ([Hu et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2022.10.010); [Swaminathan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4948))
* In practice: increase whole grains, and when feasible choose less-processed whole-grain forms instead of assuming every "whole grain" label implies the same metabolic effect. ([Aberg et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0263); [van der Kamp et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010138))
