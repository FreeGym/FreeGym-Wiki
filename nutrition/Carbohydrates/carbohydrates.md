# Carbohydrates

The most debated questions about dietary carbohydrates.

**Status:** Seeking contributors. Each section frames a controversy. Evidence needed.

## Do Carbs Make You Fat?

Carbs have been blamed for the obesity epidemic. Low-carb diets promise easy weight loss. But calories still matter. Or do they?

**Competing claims:**

1. Carbs drive insulin, insulin drives fat storage, so cutting carbs is the key to weight loss
2. Calories are all that matter, and carbs have no special fat-storing effect
3. Carbs increase appetite and make you eat more, which causes weight gain indirectly
4. Only refined carbs are the problem; whole food carbs don't cause weight gain

**Evidence needed:** Metabolic ward studies, isocaloric diet comparisons, insulin-obesity hypothesis research.

## How Many Carbs Do You Actually Need?

Recommendations range from "carbs are essential" to "you can live without them." Athletes swear by high-carb diets. Keto advocates eat almost none.

**Competing claims:**

1. There is no essential requirement for carbohydrates, since the body can make glucose from protein
2. The brain requires ~130g/day of glucose and carbs are the easiest way to provide it
3. Carb needs depend entirely on activity level; sedentary people need very few
4. Low-carb diets impair high-intensity exercise performance

**Evidence needed:** Studies on carbohydrate requirements across activity levels, ketogenic adaptation research.

## Is Low-Carb Better for Weight Loss?

Low-carb diets often produce rapid initial weight loss. But is it fat loss or water? And does the advantage persist long-term?

**Competing claims:**

1. Low-carb diets cause more fat loss than low-fat diets at the same calories
2. The initial weight loss is mostly water from glycogen depletion
3. Low-carb works better because protein is more satiating, not because carbs are removed
4. Long-term, all diets produce similar weight loss, and adherence matters more than macros

**Evidence needed:** Long-term RCTs comparing low-carb vs other diets, body composition studies.

---

## Is Keto Safe Long-Term?

Ketogenic diets have exploded in popularity. Short-term benefits are documented. But what happens after years of very low carb intake?

**Competing claims:**

1. Keto is safe long-term and may have metabolic advantages
2. Long-term keto may increase cardiovascular risk via saturated fat intake
3. Keto causes nutrient deficiencies without careful planning
4. The benefits of keto come from weight loss, not ketosis itself, so other diets work equally well

**Evidence needed:** Long-term ketogenic diet studies, cardiovascular risk data, nutrient status research.

## Do You Need Carbs to Build Muscle?

Bodybuilders traditionally eat high-carb diets. But some build muscle on keto. How important are carbs for hypertrophy?

**Competing claims:**

1. Carbs are essential for optimal muscle growth because they spike insulin, which is anabolic
2. Protein is what matters, and carbs are optional if protein is adequate
3. Carbs improve training performance, which indirectly supports muscle growth
4. Glycogen replenishment matters for athletes training twice daily, not for typical lifters

**Evidence needed:** Studies on muscle hypertrophy across carbohydrate intakes, insulin and anabolism research.

---

## Does Carb Timing Matter?

Should you eat carbs before or after workouts? Avoid them at night? Front-load them in the morning?

**Competing claims:**

1. Post-workout carbs are critical to replenish glycogen and enhance recovery
2. Carb timing only matters for elite athletes training multiple times per day
3. Eating carbs at night causes more fat storage
4. Total daily intake matters; timing is largely irrelevant for most people

**Evidence needed:** Nutrient timing studies, glycogen replenishment research, chrononutrition data.

---

## Is Sugar Really That Bad?

Sugar is the modern dietary villain. But is added sugar uniquely harmful, or is it just empty calories?

**Competing claims:**

1. Sugar is toxic, and fructose specifically damages the liver and drives metabolic disease
2. Sugar is just calories, and in moderation it's not harmful
3. Sugar is addictive and drives overconsumption, making moderation impossible
4. Added sugar is the problem; naturally occurring sugar in whole foods is fine

**Evidence needed:** Mechanistic studies on fructose metabolism, sugar and disease epidemiology, addiction research.

---

## Is the Sugar in Fruit Different?

Fruit contains fructose, the same sugar blamed for health problems. Yet fruit is considered healthy. What gives?

**Competing claims:**

1. Fruit is healthy despite the sugar because fiber slows absorption
2. Fructose is fructose, and fruit sugar has the same metabolic effects as added sugar
3. The dose matters: you'd have to eat unrealistic amounts of fruit to cause harm
4. Whole fruit is fine, but fruit juice is as bad as soda

**Evidence needed:** Studies comparing whole fruit vs added sugar, fruit juice research, fiber and glycemic response.

---

## Are Whole Grains Actually Better?

"Choose whole grains" is standard advice. But is the difference between whole and refined grains meaningful for health?

**Competing claims:**

1. Whole grains significantly reduce disease risk compared to refined grains
2. The difference is marginal, since both are processed starch
3. Whole grains are better because of fiber, not because refined grains are harmful
4. Many "whole grain" products are just refined grains with added bran, which isn't the same thing

**Evidence needed:** Epidemiological studies on grain intake and health outcomes, intervention studies.

---

## Does Glycemic Index Matter?

Low-GI diets were popular before low-carb took over. Does how fast a carb raises blood sugar actually matter for health or weight?

**Competing claims:**

1. Low-GI foods improve blood sugar control and reduce disease risk
2. Glycemic index is misleading because it changes based on what you eat with the food
3. Glycemic load (GI x amount) is more useful than GI alone
4. GI only matters for diabetics; healthy people regulate blood sugar fine regardless

**Evidence needed:** GI intervention studies, glycemic load research, diabetes prevention data.

---

## Do Carbs Cause Inflammation?

Inflammation is linked to chronic disease. Some claim carbs, especially refined ones, drive inflammation.

**Competing claims:**

1. Refined carbs and sugar cause chronic low-grade inflammation
2. Only excess calories cause inflammation, and carbs aren't uniquely inflammatory
3. Fiber-rich carbs are actually anti-inflammatory
4. The glycemic response triggers inflammation, so low-GI carbs are fine

**Evidence needed:** Studies on carbohydrate intake and inflammatory markers, mechanistic research.

---

## Does Carb Cycling Work?

Alternating high and low carb days is popular among athletes and dieters. Is there a real benefit, or is it unnecessary complexity?

**Competing claims:**

1. Carb cycling optimizes both fat burning (low days) and performance (high days)
2. Weekly carb average is what matters; cycling provides no metabolic advantage
3. Carb cycling helps with diet adherence by allowing periodic high-carb meals
4. Only elite athletes benefit; recreational exercisers are overcomplicating things

**Evidence needed:** Carb cycling intervention studies, metabolic flexibility research.

---

## Are Carbs Bad for Your Brain?

Some claim carbs cause brain fog, cognitive decline, or even Alzheimer's ("type 3 diabetes"). Others say the brain runs best on glucose.

**Competing claims:**

1. The brain prefers glucose, and low-carb diets impair cognitive function
2. Ketones are a superior brain fuel, and the brain works better without carbs
3. Blood sugar swings from refined carbs impair cognition; stable carbs are fine
4. Long-term high carb intake may contribute to dementia risk

**Evidence needed:** Cognitive studies on different diets, ketones and brain function research, Alzheimer's and diet data.
