# Is low-carb better for weight loss?

Across randomized trials, low-carb and low-fat diets produce similar average weight loss. Any early advantage for low-carb tends to shrink by 12 months, and when differences persist, they're typically under 1 kg on average. ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full); [Ge et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m696))

When low-carb diets produce rapid early scale weight loss, metabolic ward data suggest much of it can be water rather than fat. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

## What "low-carb" means in the evidence

In clinical research, "low-carb" covers a range of approaches, commonly defined in absolute grams rather than percent of calories. ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full))

One common framing distinguishes non-ketogenic low-carb diets (~50–150 g/day) from ketogenic very-low-carb diets (≤50 g/day). Some broader definitions label anything under 200 g/day as "low carb." ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full))

Low-carb interventions often change more than carbohydrate - fat intake, protein intake, and food choices all shift. So "low-carb vs low-fat" comparisons aren't always "carbs removed, everything else identical." ([Shai et al., 2008](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708681))

## Rapid early weight loss: fat or water?

A metabolic ward study switched participants to an isocaloric ketogenic diet and saw rapid additional weight loss of about 1.6 kg. The authors concluded this was likely water: fat mass changed by only ~0.2 kg over the next 15 days. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

The water-vs-fat evidence is strongest for very-low-carb/ketogenic starts. Early weight change can overstate fat loss if you only look at the scale. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

## Does low-carb cause more fat loss at the same calories?

In a metabolic ward crossover study designed to compare carbohydrate restriction vs fat restriction calorie-for-calorie, fat restriction produced greater body fat loss: ~89 g/day vs ~53 g/day over a short 6-day window. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021))

In the isocaloric ketogenic study discussed above, the ketogenic diet was not accompanied by increased body fat loss despite the rapid scale drop. Early low-carb "wins" on the scale can be largely water rather than extra fat. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

These inpatient isocaloric findings directly contradict the claim that low-carb causes more fat loss than low-fat at matched calories - at least in the short timeframes that can be tightly controlled. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021); [Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

## Long-term RCTs: does the advantage persist?

A 2022 Cochrane systematic review concluded there is "probably little to no difference" in weight reduction between low-carb and balanced-carb weight-reducing diets up to two years. Average difference: ~1 kg short term, under 1 kg long term. ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full))

A large BMJ network meta-analysis found low-carb and low-fat had similar weight loss at 6 months (~4.63 kg vs ~4.37 kg vs usual diet). Weight loss diminished at 12 months across all macronutrient patterns. ([Ge et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m696))

In the DIETFITS trial, "healthy low-fat" and "healthy low-carb" produced no statistically significant difference at 12 months: about −5.3 kg vs −6.0 kg. ([Gardner et al., 2018](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2673150))

In the 2-year DIRECT trial, mean weight loss was 2.9 kg (low-fat), 4.4 kg (Mediterranean), and 4.7 kg (low-carb). But the low-carb arm was non-calorie-restricted (ad libitum) while low-fat and Mediterranean were calorie-restricted, so this is an effectiveness comparison, not an isocaloric macronutrient test. ([Shai et al., 2008](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708681))

In the POUNDS LOST trial (2 years), energy-reduced diets differing in macronutrient composition produced similar weight loss across groups. Macro ratios alone don't reliably determine long-term results. ([Sacks et al., 2009](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0804748))

## If removing carbs isn't a fat-loss advantage, why does low-carb help some people?

In a 4-week inpatient crossover study comparing an ad libitum plant-based low-fat diet with an ad libitum animal-based ketogenic diet, participants ate ~689 kcal/day fewer on the low-fat diet over 2 weeks. Low-carb is not inherently appetite-reducing in all contexts. ([Hall et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01209-1))

Protein is a plausible contributor. Many low-carb diets increase protein intake relative to comparators. ([Shai et al., 2008](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708681))

A meta-analysis comparing isocaloric high-protein vs standard-protein (both low-fat) found modest additional reductions in body weight and fat mass, with attenuation of fat-free mass loss. Some trials reported greater satiety. ([Wycherley et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.044321))

When low-carb "works better" for someone in free-living settings, the most evidence-consistent explanations are behavioral and dietary-structure effects (food rules that reduce energy intake) and/or higher protein - not a calorie-for-calorie metabolic advantage from removing carbohydrate. ([Wycherley et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.044321); [Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021); [Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full))

## Quick reference values

* Cochrane (low-carb vs balanced-carb, up to 2 years): ~1 kg short term, <1 kg long term. Little to no difference overall. ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full))
* BMJ network meta-analysis: ~4–5 kg weight loss vs usual diet at 6 months for both low-carb and low-fat. Weight loss diminished at 12 months. ([Ge et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m696))
* DIETFITS (12 months): ~−5.3 kg (healthy low-fat) vs ~−6.0 kg (healthy low-carb). No significant difference. ([Gardner et al., 2018](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2673150))
* Isocaloric ketogenic metabolic ward: ~1.6 kg rapid weight loss described as likely water, with only ~0.2 kg fat mass change over 15 days. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))

## Practical interpretation

* Fat loss at equal calories: controlled inpatient evidence does not support a low-carb advantage. In one metabolic ward crossover, fat restriction caused greater body fat loss than carbohydrate restriction. ([Hall et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.021))
* Why the scale drops fast initially: inpatient ketogenic data support that early loss can be disproportionately water, so early results can look better than later results even if fat loss is not greater. ([Hall et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.133561))
* Long-term outcomes: differences between low-carb and low-fat are small on average and tend to diminish by 12 months. Sustainability and adherence are likely decisive. ([Naude et al., 2022](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013334.pub2/full); [Ge et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m696); [Gardner et al., 2018](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2673150))
* If low-carb helps you eat fewer calories, part of the benefit may be protein and dietary structure, since high-protein diets show modest advantages in meta-analysis and low-carb arms sometimes increase protein. ([Wycherley et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.044321); [Shai et al., 2008](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708681))
