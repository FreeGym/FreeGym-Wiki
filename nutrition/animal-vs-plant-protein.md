## Animal vs plant protein

"Animal protein is superior" is usually a claim about protein quality per gram (digestibility and indispensable amino-acid profile), whereas "plant protein is equivalent" is usually a claim about real-world outcomes when total protein and diet design are matched (hypertrophy, strength, performance). (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025; Lim et al., 2021) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"); [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661"))

The most useful evidence for settling the debate comes from longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their systematic reviews/meta-analyses, because acute muscle protein synthesis (MPS) findings do not always predict long-term hypertrophy. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

## Competing claims and what evidence can actually test

The claim that animal proteins are superior rests on amino-acid profiles and bioavailability. It predicts that, _at equal grams of protein_, animal protein should more consistently improve muscle outcomes, especially when plant proteins are lower-quality sources or when diets are difficult to execute at high protein intakes. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2024) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"); [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748"))

The claim that plant proteins are equivalent applies when total intake and variety are adequate. It predicts that, when total protein is high and matched and the plant diet uses higher-quality plant proteins and/or varied sources, outcomes should converge. (Hevia‑Larraín et al., 2021; Monteyne et al., 2023; Domić et al., 2025) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

A third claim is that "complete vs incomplete protein" is often outdated and misleading. It predicts that amino-acid adequacy is primarily a diet-pattern issue (total protein + variety), not a rule that must be satisfied _within a single food or even a single meal_. (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"))

## What RCT meta-analyses say about muscle mass and strength

### Systematic review/meta-analysis focused on plant vs animal protein for muscle outcomes (2025)

A large systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs comparing plant with animal protein reported the following. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

For muscle mass, plant protein showed a small disadvantage overall (standardized mean difference SMD = −0.20, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.03). This pooled effect was more apparent in younger (<60 y) than older (≥60 y) adults.

There was no pooled difference between soy and milk protein for muscle mass (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.16; n=17 RCTs). However, animal protein was superior to non-soy plant proteins (rice/chia/oat/potato grouped) and to plant-based diet interventions in the subgrouped pooled analyses.

For strength and physical performance, there was no significant difference between plant and animal protein overall (n=14 RCTs for strength, n=5 for performance), though some endpoint/subgroup analyses (e.g., lower-body strength in older adults) favored animal protein.

The best current RCT synthesis suggests protein source can matter a little for muscle mass, but the average effect is small, appears protein-type dependent (soy ≈ milk in pooled results), and does not clearly translate to consistent strength differences in pooled analyses. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

### Systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs in generally healthy adults (2021)

Another systematic review/meta-analysis reported no significant differences between animal and plant protein in changes in absolute lean mass or muscle strength overall in pooled analyses. A beneficial effect of animal protein on percent lean mass was observed in the pooled analysis, though this result was not stable to leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. In a <50 y subgroup, animal protein showed a reported advantage for absolute lean mass (~0.41 kg) and percent lean mass (~0.50%), while this was not observed in the older subgroup. (Lim et al., 2021) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661"))

These two meta-analyses are not identical in inclusion criteria and grouping (e.g., soy vs non-soy distinctions), which helps explain why one finds a small muscle-mass edge for animal protein while the other emphasizes overall similarity except for certain metrics and subgroups. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025; Lim et al., 2021) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"); [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661"))

### Plant-based diet strength meta-analysis (2025)

A separate systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs comparing plant-based diet (PBD) interventions with omnivorous diets reported no significant differences in upper body, lower body, or overall muscular strength outcomes in pooled analyses. (López‑Moreno et al., 2025) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40798-025-00852-7 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40798-025-00852-7"))

## Can plant-based diets provide adequate protein for athletes and lifters?

They can, when protein is adequate and the diet is designed to hit targets reliably, but some evidence suggests plant proteins may be slightly less effective on average than animal proteins in aggregated performance outcomes, depending on the comparison and the plant protein used. (Zhao et al., 2024; Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748"); [OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

### Whole-diet (or near whole-diet) trials: matched protein, similar training adaptations

In a 12-week resistance training trial in young men with protein matched at ~1.6 g/kg/day, habitual vegans and omnivores were brought to the same protein target using soy isolate (vegans) or whey (omnivores). Both groups increased leg lean mass by ~1.2 kg and improved muscle size and leg-press strength, with no between-group differences for the primary outcomes. (Note: participants were classified by habitual diet; they were not randomized to adopt vegan vs omnivorous diets.) (Hevia‑Larraín et al., 2021) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9"))

A trial in young adults found that omnivorous and vegan (non-animal-derived, mycoprotein-rich) high-protein diets supported comparable daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, translating to similar skeletal muscle adaptive responses during prolonged resistance training, under the diet/protein conditions tested. (Monteyne et al., 2023) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800"))

In active older adults (~72 y), a controlled crossover trial lasting 10 days found that a vegan diet designed with a large variety of plant protein sources produced no difference in integrated daily mixed MPS compared with an isocaloric, isonitrogenous omnivorous diet (vegan 1.23 ± 0.04%/d vs omnivorous 1.29 ± 0.04%/d, P=0.2542). This was a short-term mechanistic endpoint, not a direct hypertrophy endpoint. (Domić et al., 2025) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

These trials support the idea that, when protein intake is deliberately made sufficient and matched, plant-based patterns can support important anabolic outcomes relevant to training. (Hevia‑Larraín et al., 2021; Monteyne et al., 2023; Domić et al., 2025) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

### Athletic performance meta-analysis (2024): plant-based protein helps vs low protein, but may lag vs other protein types

A Bayesian meta-analysis with systematic review of RCTs evaluating plant-based protein ingestion on athletic ability found that plant-based protein outperformed no/low protein comparators (reported SMD ~0.281, with uncertainty intervals reported). Compared with other protein types, plant-based protein showed a small reported disadvantage for athletic ability outcomes in the meta-analytic summary (reported SMD ~−0.119), with other protein types showing greater benefit for muscle strength in one analysis approach. (Zhao et al., 2024) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748"))

If you interpret "superior" as "wins on average in aggregated performance outcomes," this meta-analysis leans slightly toward animal/other proteins. If you interpret "adequate" as "can support meaningful gains vs insufficient protein," it supports plant-based protein as effective. (Zhao et al., 2024) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748"))

## Does "complete vs incomplete protein" matter?

### What "complete" actually refers to

"Complete protein" is typically shorthand for a single protein source that provides indispensable amino acids in a pattern that meets human needs (often discussed relative to reference scoring patterns). (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"))

Many plant-based diets achieve adequate amino acids by mixing plant protein sources across the day, and the review argues that concerns about amino-acid deficiency are often overstated in typical Western vegetarian/vegan patterns when protein-rich plant foods are included. (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"))

### When "incomplete" becomes relevant again

The same review notes that lysine might become limiting mainly in vegan individuals with low protein intake and a very limited or monotonous pattern (e.g., relying heavily on grains alone), which it frames as unrealistic in developed-country settings with at least modest dietary variety. (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"))

For resistance training and athletic contexts where total protein needs are often intentionally higher, "complete vs incomplete" is usually less informative than total protein achieved consistently, and whether the diet includes protein-rich plant foods (legumes, soy, nuts, seeds, and other high-protein staples), which helps keep indispensable amino acids adequate at the diet level. (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019; Bakaloudi et al., 2021) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567"))

## Limits and open debates (what the evidence does _not_ settle yet)

- "Plant protein" is not one thing. Soy performed similarly to milk protein in pooled RCT analyses, while non-soy plant proteins and whole-diet plant-based interventions sometimes looked less favorable for muscle mass in subgrouped analyses. The 2025 review explicitly calls for more trials across a wider range of plant proteins and diets. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

- Feasibility matters. Vegan diets tend to be lower in protein intake in observational datasets synthesized in a systematic review, meaning the limiting factor in practice may be _hitting the intake target consistently_ rather than physiology. (Bakaloudi et al., 2021) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567"))

- Bioavailability concerns can be mitigated but not ignored. Trials that engineered vegan diets to be isonitrogenous and built from a variety of plant protein sources found comparable daily MPS in older adults, but that is evidence about _well-designed_ plant-based diets, not all plant-based diets by default. (Domić et al., 2025) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

## Quick reference findings

- 2025 RCT meta-analysis: plant vs animal protein
    - Muscle mass: small disadvantage for plant protein overall (SMD −0.20). (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))
    - Strength: no significant pooled difference overall; some endpoint/subgroup analyses (e.g., lower-body strength in older adults) favored animal protein. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))
    - Soy vs milk: no pooled difference in muscle mass (SMD −0.02). (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"))

- 2021 RCT meta-analysis: animal vs plant protein in healthy adults
    - No significant overall differences for absolute lean mass or strength; animal protein favored percent lean mass (noted as sensitivity-unstable in leave-one-out analyses), and younger subgroup effects were reported in the abstract. (Lim et al., 2021) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/661"))

- Whole-diet trials (matched/high protein):
    - 12 weeks training, ~1.6 g/kg/day, vegans (soy) vs omnivores (whey): similar lean-mass and strength gains. (Hevia‑Larraín et al., 2021) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9"))
    - High-protein vegan vs omnivorous: comparable daily myofibrillar protein synthesis and hypertrophy during training, under the conditions tested. (Monteyne et al., 2023) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800"))
    - Active older adults, controlled crossover: no difference in daily mixed MPS on vegan vs omnivorous diets (short-term mechanistic endpoint). (Domić et al., 2025) ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

- Athletic performance RCT meta-analysis:
    - Plant-based protein beats low/no protein, but shows a small disadvantage vs other protein types in pooled summaries. (Zhao et al., 2024) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2748"))

## Practical interpretation

- "Animal protein is superior" is not universally true when you look at well-controlled longitudinal training trials with adequate protein. Multiple controlled interventions show comparable hypertrophy/strength outcomes with well-designed high-protein vegan diets and matched protein targets, and controlled crossover data show comparable daily MPS under well-designed vegan diets in older adults. (Hevia‑Larraín et al., 2021; Monteyne et al., 2023; Domić et al., 2025) ([Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9 "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-021-01434-9"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623126800"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662401246X"))

- "Plant protein is equivalent" is too broad if it ignores plant-protein heterogeneity and the reality that many people on vegan diets consume less protein without deliberate planning. Pooled RCT syntheses show small average differences in muscle mass in some comparisons and diet patterns. (Reid‑McCann et al., 2025; Bakaloudi et al., 2021) ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494 "https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/7/e1581/7954494"); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567 "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420306567"))

- "Complete vs incomplete protein" is best treated as a food-level label that can distract from the more important variables: total protein and inclusion of protein-rich plant foods/variety. The review evidence argues deficiency concerns are commonly overstated in typical varied vegetarian/vegan diets, with caveats for low-protein or highly monotonous patterns. (Mariotti & Gardner, 2019) ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661 "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2661"))
